# Intro

I am learning how to program in Rust, following their [book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu)!

# Installation (Ch 1)

## Linux/Mac

1. Install `rustup`

```zsh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Notes:

-   `rustup` is for managing the version of Rust on machine
-   'RUSTUP_HOME' env variable for rustup metadata/toolchains/etc
    -   defaults to `~/.rustup`
-   `CARGO_HOME` env var for cargo
    -   defaults to `~/.cargo`
    -   cargo, rustc, and rustup commands will be in `$CARGO_HOME/bin`

### To Update

`rustup update`

### To Uninstall

`rustup self uninstall`

### docs

`rustup docs`

# Project Creation with Cargo (Ch 1.3)

`cargo new <project name>`

`Cargo.toml` file -> Basically `package.json`

-   `[package]` name, version, etc.
-   `[dependencies]`: project dependencies ("crates")

## Build

`cargo build`

-   automatically builds to `target/debug`
-   Can run with `./target/debug/<project name>`

`cargo run`

-   builds and runs

`cargo check`

-   make sure it'll compile first

## Release

`cargo build --release`

-   use for releases and benchmarking

# First Program (Guessing Game, Ch 2)

-   imports section is called the _prelude_.

```rust
use std::io;
```

-   uses `let` to declare variable:
    -   variables are immutable by default
    -   use `mut` to make it mutable

```rust
let apples = 5;
//or
let mut guess = String::new();
```

-   Uses references:
    -   references are also immutable by default

```rust
io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut guess);
```

-   String interpolation

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!("x = {x} and y + 2 = {}", y + 2);
```

-   range inclusive: `start..=end`
-   docs:

    -   `cargo docs --open`
    -   WSL workaround: `explorer.exe .` -> navigate to target/docs/\<package\> open `index.html` in browser

-   `::<>` is called turbofish lol

# Core Concepts (Ch 3)

## 3.1 Variables and Mutability

-   variables are immutable by default
-   make variable mutable by: `let mut x = 5`
-   `const`s cannot use `mut`
    -   have to define type
    -   can be declared in any scope, including global
    -   Cannot use a variable to assign value
    -   all uppercase, snake_cased
-   `const` can be used in the global scope, while `let` can only be used in a function

You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable in a process called "shadowing". The first variable is _shadowed_ by the second.

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;

  let x = x + 1;

  {
    let x = x * 2;
    println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
  }

  println!("The value of x is: {x}");

}
```

-   When shadowing, we're effectively creating a new variable, so we don't have to adhere to the same type as we would have to do using `mut`

```rust
let mut spaces = "    "; //string
let spaces = spaces.len(); // int
```

## 3.2 Data Types

Rust is statically typed.

Scalar Types:

1. integers
2. floats
3. bools
4. chars

### Integers

-   signed and unsigned
-   Neat table from book:

| Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |

-   Signed vs Unsigned refers to if number can be negative
-   Signed numbers are stored using two's compliment representation
-   Each signed variant can store numbers from `-2^(n-1)` to `2^(n-1) - 1`
    -   `i8` can store from -128 to 127
-   Unsigned variants can store from 0 to `2^n - 1`
    -   `u8` can store from 0 to 255
-   `isize` and `usize` depend on the arch type of the computer (64 if on 64-bit architecture, 32 if on 32-bit)

> Literals:

Number literals can use `_` as a visual separator

-   Decimal: 1_000 = 1000
-   Hex: 0xff
-   Octal: 0o77
-   Binary: 0b1111_0000
-   Byte (u8 only): b'A'

> Which integer type to use?

If unsure, Rust defaults to i32. The primary place you'd see `isize` and `usize` is when indexing some sort of collection.

> Overflow

Rust compiler will _not_ check for overflow that cause panics when compiling in `--release` mode, only in debug mode. Instead, Rust performs two's complement wrapping. Values greater than the maximum value the type can hold "wrap around" to the minimum of the values the type can hold. The program won't panic, but the variable will have a value that isn't what we expected.

To explicitly handle overflow, use these methods in the standard lib:

-   Wrap in all modes: `wrapping_*` methods, like `wrapping_add`
-   Return `None` if there is overflow with `checked_*`
-   Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with `overflowing_*`
-   Saturate at the value's minimum or maximum values with `saturating_*`

### Floats

`f32` and `f64`. Default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs it's about the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision.

All floats are signed.

-   `f32` is single-precision
-   `f64` had double-precision

### Numeric Operations

```Rust
fn main() {
  let sum = 5 + 10;
  let diff = 95.5 - 4.3;
  let product = 4 * 30;
  let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
  let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1
  let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

### Boolean

`bool`.  Yup.

### Char

Notated with single quotes. `char`.

```Rust
fn main() {
  let c = 'z';
  let z: char = 'Z'; //with explicit type annotation
  let emoji = 'ðŸ¤ ';
}
```

- `char` is 4 bytes
- represents a Unicode Scalar Value
  - ASCII and beyond

### Compound Types

Can group multiple values into one type.  Tuples and Arrays

#### Tuples:

- fixed length

```Rust
fn main() {
  let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```
The variable `tup` above, bind to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a single compound element.  To get the individual values out, we can use pattern matching to destructure:

```Rust
fn main() {
  let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

  let (x, y , z) = tup;

  println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

We can also access indexes of the tuple directly like so: `tup.0`

A tuple without any values is called a `unit`, written as `()`. Represents an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don't return any other value.

#### Arrays

- Every element must be the same type
- fixed length
- allocated on the stack
- not as flexible as the `vector` type
- typed using the following pattern: `[type; size]`

```Rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

- accessed with `a[0]`
- program will panic if array goes out of bounds
- The syntax [x; y] declares an array with y copies of x

## 3.3 Functions

- uses snake_case for function and variable names
- must declare parameter type
- calling a function is an expression
- calling a macro is an expression
- a new scope block created with curlies is an expression

```Rust
fn main() {
  let y = {
    let x = 3;
    x + 1 // No semicolon?
  };

  println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

From the book:
> If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.


- annotate return values with `-> TYPE`
- most functions return the last expression implicitly


## 3.4 Comments

```Rust
// ...yup
```

- There are also doc comments `///` i guess

## 3.5 Control Flow

Most common
- if expressions
- lÃ¶Ã¶ps

### `if`

- condition must be a boolean, no js magicianry 
- using if in a let statement:

```Rust
// feels like a ternary tbh
let condition = true;
let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
```

### LÃ¶Ã¶ps

3 kinds of loops: 
- `loop`
- `while`
- `for`

LOOP LABELS?!?!?
- disambiguate between multiple loops!!!!!
  - ARE YOU KIDDING ME????
- must begin with a single quote
  - see `/loops/main.rs`

While loops, pretty standard. 

For loops:

```rs
fn main() {
  let a = [10,20,30,40,50]

  for element in a {
    println!("the value is: {element}");
  }
}
```

see also:

```rs
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

# Ownership (Ch 4)
- took a break here to see how far I could make it in Rustinlings, got to problem 21 aka primitive_types4
  

Guarantees memory safety without needing garbage collection

## 4.1 What is ownership?

**Safety is the absence of undefined behavior**

i.e - don't use a variable before it's defined or has a value

- Checks for safety at compile time
- Variables live in the stack
  - a variable's value is copied from it's slot in the stack frame
  - frames in the stack are associated with a specific function and are deallocated when the function returns
- Boxes live in the heap
  - copying can take up a lot of memory
    - ex: copying an array of 1 million elements
    - transfers access to data without using it with pointers
      - a common way to make a pointer is to allocate memory in the heap
        - the heap is a separate region of memory where **data can live indefinitely**
        - not tied to a stack frame
      - Rust provides a construct called `Box` for putting data on the heap

```rust
let a = Box::new([0;1_000_000]);
let b = a;
```

- there is only a single array in memory
- the statement `let b = a` copies the pointer from a into b

***Rust does not permit manual memory management***
- no malloc or dealloc
- stack frames are automatically managed by rust
- cannot free declared Box, otherwise could lead to memory management bugs, leading to undefined behavior
- Rust automatically frees a box's heap memory
> (almost correct) if a variable is bound to a box, when rust deallocates the variable's frame, then rust deallocates the box's heap memory

```rust
let a = Box::new([0; 1_000_000]);
let b = a;
```

By the almost correct principal above, Rust would try to free the box's heap memory twice on behalf of both variables.  That is undefined behavior!

Hence, ***Ownership!***

When `a` is bound to `Box::new([0;1_000_000])`, `a` owns the box.  The statement `let b = a` moves ownership from `a` to `b`.

> (fully accurate) If a variable owns a box, when Rust deallocates the variable's frame, then Rust deallocates the box's heap memory

### Collections use boxes!

Boxes are used by Rust data structures like `Vec`, `String`, and `HashMap` to hold a variable number of elements.  

> Moved Heap Data Principle: if a variable `x` moves ownership of heap data to another variable `y`, then `x` cannot be used after the move.

**Cloning avoids moves**

- `.clone()` method will do a deep copy


## 4.2 References and Borrowing

***References are non-owning pointers***
- because they do not own the data they point to

```rust
fn main() {
  let m1 = String::from("Hello")
  let m2 = String::from("world")
  greet(&m1, &m2)
  let s = format("{} {}", m1, m2);
}

fn greet(g1: &String, g2: &String) {
  println!("{} {}", g1, g2);
}
```
**Dereferencing a Pointer Accesses its data**

**Rust avoids simultaneous aliasing and mutation**

- Pointers enable aliasing
  - aliasing = accessing the same data through different variables.
    - harmless on its own
    - combined with mutation, could be bad

> Pointer Safety Principle: data should never be aliased and mutated at the same time

Since references are non-owning pointers, they need different rules than Boxes.  Hence, the ***borrow checker***!

### The Borrow Checker

Core idea is that variables have 3 kinds of permissions:

1. Read(R): data that can be copied to another location
2. Write(W): data can be mutated in-place
3. Own(O): data can be moved or dropped

These don't exist at runtime, only within the compilter.

- A variable has RO permissions by default
  - gets W if annotated with `let mut`
  - references can temporarily remove permissions

**The borrow checker finds permission violations**

- if a value is being borrowed, we can't perform a write operation

**Mutable references provide unique and non-owning access to data**

- mutable reference created with `&mut`
- allows mutation but prevents aliasing as the borrowed path becomes temporarily unusable
- can be temporarily downgraded to read only references

**Permissions are returned at the end of a references lifetime*

**Data must outlive all of its references**

- can't drop a variable while a reference to it still exists
- introduces the *flow* (`F`) permission
  - a reference has `F` if it's allowed to be used in a particular expression

## 4.3 Fixing Ownership Errors

*this goes over a few case studies*

A few notes from this section:
- it is rare for Rust functions to take ownership of heap-owning data structures like `Vec` and `String`
- Functions should not mutate their inputs if the caller would not expect it

## 4.4 The Slice Type

- a slice is a non-owning pointer
  
```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello: &str = &s[0..5];
let world: &str = &s[6..1];
let s2: &String = &s;
```

## 4.5 Ownership Recap

**Ownership vs. Garbage Collection**

Garbage Collectors:
- works at runtime, adjacent to a running program
- scans through memory to find data that's no longer used
- avoids undefined behavior
- avoids the need for a complex type system to check for undef. behavior
- Performance drawback
  - reference counting
  - tracing
- Can be unpredictable

Ownership:
- predictable
- more performant

**Ownership Concepts**

At runtime:
- allocates local variables in stack frames
- variables can hold data or pointers
- pointers can be created through boxes or references
- slices are references that point to a contiguous sequence of data in memory

At compile-time:
- tracks RWO permissions on each variable
- requires variables have the appropriate permissions for given operation
- permissions can be changes if variable is moved or borrowed
